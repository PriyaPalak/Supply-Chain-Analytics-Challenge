# :truck: Codebasics Supply Chain Analytics Challenge

## :muscle: About the Challenge

This is the 2nd Challenge by the CodeBasics team.

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer based in the state of Gujrat. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years. But they are facing issues in providing proper customer service, like the deliveries being delayed and not being made in full. Before expansion, they want to fix these issues. So, the company wants the Supply Chain Analytics team to track the service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can swiftly respond to these issues.

Being a part of the Supply Chain Analytics team, design a dashboard to track the relevant metrics mainly OT % (on-time delivery), IF %(In-full delivery) and OTIF % (On-time In-full delivery) against the target level set for each customer.
